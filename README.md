CANOPY
======

CANOPY (first named for "Chicago Allocation to Neigbhorhood-Oriented Programs for Youth") is a algorithm intended to assist policy makers with complex decision-making problems. The class of problems CANOPY was designed to assist with feature:

* the need to "optimally" distribute some resource (e.g. dollars of public funding, or service centers) across space;
* a large number of candidate recipients of that resource (e.g. sites to be funded, or candidate locations);
* a complex objective (e.g. one that considers many factors, like multiple characteristics of local populations, both in terms of quantity and quality) that defines the notion of "optimality".

CANOPY uses a [simulated annealing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) algorithm adapted to optimization of spatial policy allocations. Given statement of an objective function, a given total resource, and characteristics of the candidate recipients, the algorithm identifies promising candidate allocations that can be offered to human decision makers for review, whether to inform an improved run of the algorithm (perhaps by adjusting the objective function), or for finishing by human logic that cannot be well represented in the algorithm. The advantages of using CANOPY assistance include:
1. saves time relative to a human process of deliberating over candidate allocations;
2. requires taking a concrete, transparent position on the objective of a policy;
3. works with more rapid and consistent logic from start to finish than humans can do; and
4. can easily incorporate more complexity in the consideration of many factors than humans can do.
 
## Project Development

This project is currently in beta form, applied to a simple motivating example.
