  ### This is likely for a different file -- a server.r file for the Shiny application we'll build
  
  # Conditional selection for prioritizing all youth, versus weights by poverty...
  # Sliders are: relative weight placed on youth of different backgrounds, total amount of resources
  #   made available, number of iterations offered to the run, (# of initializations, or # of
  #   restarts from previous best solution? ... these may be too technical)

  ### Brainstormed elements:
  # Progress bar, based on the # of iterations run so far (x% complete), and plot of checkpoints
  #   showing the best value seen so far. The (x% complete) bar can be flipped on through a flag that
  #   is hit once the annealing routine is called, and flipped off when it's done.
  # Bar chart showing the benchmark values, which highlights the added value from using
